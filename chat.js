I'm curious, I keep learning, I'm honest about what I know and don't, and I genuinely care about shipping quality software, not just passing tests.

I raised clear, well-documented bugs, pushed for better test coverage and process, and was proactive about learning the product deeply so my feedback was actually useful. On the agentic AI side, that same clarity helped the team reason about prompts, guardrails, and edge cases that are easy to miss. Overall, I made quality everyone's responsibility, not just QA's.` },

Beyond the tools though, I think my biggest strength is thinking like a user and catching the edge cases other people miss.` },

I also push on edge cases like ambiguous or adversarial input, so the bot fails gracefully instead of hallucinating.` },

It wasn't reproducible on the first few tries, so I had to dig into the sequence and timing of events rather than just the UI, document the exact conditions, and work with engineering to trace it to a race condition on the backend. It taught me to always think about timing and concurrency, not just individual steps.` },

    { test: (t) => /mentor/.test(t), answer: () => `I lead by example first — pairing on real test cases and automation scripts rather than just telling people what to do. I encourage juniors to ask why something is a bug, not just what is broken, give specific feedback on their test cases and defect reports, and give them room to make mistakes on lower-risk areas so they build judgment, not just checklist habits.` },
    { test: (t) => /(decide|choose).*automat|what.*automate/.test(t), answer: () => `I automate things that are repetitive, stable, and high-value — core regression paths, critical user journeys, API contracts — since those pay off every release cycle. New, frequently changing, or visually sensitive features I keep manual or exploratory at first, and only automate once they stabilize. High-risk but rarely-changing flows are strong automation candidates; still-evolving ones aren't worth the maintenance yet.` },
    { test: (t) => /validate.*(ai agent|agent)|ai agent.*valid/.test(t), answer: () => `I treat it like testing a person, not just a program — checking it retrieves the right context (RAG accuracy), responds appropriately across varied and unexpected phrasing, respects its guardrails, and stays consistent across multi-turn conversations. I also test how it fails: does it hallucinate, does it clearly say when it doesn't know something, does it stay safe under adversarial or off-topic prompts. It's a mix of scripted scenarios and exploratory "break it" testing.` },
